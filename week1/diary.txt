today, I exercised grid css, matertial css, they are amazing. I tried to build a template website with grid, 
but it seems takes longer time than I have. so I just drop it aside and worked on JS week1.
Js week1 was too easy and mainly very basic rules. 
I coded along on a simple calculator. 

I worked 9 hours today. 

1:30 am till 5 am. 

10:30 am till 13:30 pm. 

19:pm till 23:00 pm.
